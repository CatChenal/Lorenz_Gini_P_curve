# LGP: the Lorenz-Gini-P curve


## A Lorenz Curve is a scatter plot of two series of cumulative proportions:
The x-axis records the cumulative proportion of some population (people, rabbits, defective widgets etc.) 
ranked by the cumulative proportion of an associated y-measure (income, births, cost of repairs, etc.).  
It is therefore, a square plot with (0,1) ranges.

To reproduce the "augmented" Lorenz curve (Figure 2) in this paper by Kunegis and Preusse, "Fairness on the Web: Alternatives to the Power Law" in *WebSci* 2012, June 22â€“24, 2012, Evanston, Illinois, USA::

> Figure 2. Statistics associated with the Pareto principle. [...]The Lorenz curve (continuous line) gives rise to two statistics: The Gini coefficient G is twice the gray area and the balanced inequality ratio P is the point at which the antidiagonal crosses the Lorenz curve.


The 'the balanced inequality ratio P' that Kunegis and Preusse identify is typically used in a statement echoing the Pareto principle, e.g.: P% of all <users/objects> account for X% of all <some measures/resources...>.

# The Gini coefficient:  

## The Gini coefficient can be obtained graphically:  
The area below the diagonal is equal to half the total area of the square;  
It is also equal to the area between the diagonal and the Lorenz curve = A, 
plus what's left = B.  
Therefore, the Gini coefficient, G is:  G = A/(A+B)   
Since A+B = 0.5, **G = 2A**




## Examplar output of the function `LorenzGiniP.plot_lorenz_GP()`:

## Gini = 0% when the distributions are identical:

## Gini = 100% when the distributions are extremely skewed:

## Gini = intermedate in other cases:

### Hope this helps!

#### TODO: 
* Refine plotting function to enable args as style dicts for plot text and figure save options.
* Increase fig height to  prevent croping of caption.

    "The x-axis records the cumulative proportion of some population (people, rabbits, defective widgets etc.) \n",
    "ranked by the cumulative proportion of an associated y-measure (income, births, cost of repairs, etc.).  \n",
    "It is therefore, a square plot with (0,1) ranges.\n",

    "\n",
    "The 'the balanced inequality ratio P' that Kunegis and Preusse identify is typically used in a statement echoing the Pareto principle, e.g.: P% of all <users/objects> account for X% of all <some measures/resources...>.\n",

    "It is also equal to the area between the diagonal and the Lorenz curve = A, \n",
